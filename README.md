## Basic :
1. **help() :** `help(lst.count)`
2. **type() :** `type(a)`
3. **print() :**
    1. **_print ( f ' ' )_**   
    `name = 'jose'`  
    `print(f'Hello, his name is {name}')`  
    `Hello, his name is jose`
    2. **_print ( " { r : width . precision } ". format ( r = result ) )_**<br/>
    `print("The result was {r:3.10}".format(r=result))` -> `The result was 0.1287001287`  
    `print("The result was {r:1.3f}".format(r=result))` -> `The result was 0.129`  
    `print("The result was {r:10.3f}".format(r=result))` -> `The result was      0.129`  
    `Width means the white space before the numbers`
